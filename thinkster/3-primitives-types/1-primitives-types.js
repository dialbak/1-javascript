/**
 * There are 6 primitive types in JavaScript:
 * <pre>
 *     string: a sequence of characters
 *     number: a numerical value, including whole numbers as well as numbers with decimals
 *     boolean: true/false values
 *     undefined: the absence of a value
 *     null: the intentional absence of a value
 *     Symbol: provides unique identifiers for variables
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * There is one more type in JavaScript, object, but it's not considered a primitive type. We'll talk about it later in the course.
