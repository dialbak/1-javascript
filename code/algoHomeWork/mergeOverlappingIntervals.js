/**

 * <p>
 Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of arbitrary intervals,
 merges any overlapping intervals, and returns the new intervals in no
 particular order.
 </p>
 <p>
 Each interval intervalis an array of two integers, with
 interval[0] as the start of the interval and
 interval[1] as the end of the interval.
 </p>
 <p>
 Note that back-to-back intervals aren't considered to be overlapping. For
 example, [1, 5] and [6, 7] aren't overlapping;
 however, [1, 6] and [6, 7] <i>are</i> indeed
 overlapping.
 </p>
 <p>
 Also note that the start of any particular interval will always be less than
 or equal to the end of that interval.
 </p>
 Sample Input
 intervals = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [4, 7], [6, 8], [9, 10]]

 <p>
 Sample Output
 [[1, 2], [3, 8], [9, 10]]
 </p>
 // Merge the intervals [3, 5], [4, 7], and [6, 8].
 // The intervals could be ordered differently.
 </pre>
